In this assignment, we use a portion of IMDB data to create a K-Nearest-Neighbor model to simulat a recommender system for a movie platform such as Netflix
Input into the model is 30 sample movies with their IMDB scores and genres classified

Using SKLearns NearestNeighbors library we generate a model using that training set. We then use a sample movie to find the 5 most similar movies.

In this instance we used the movie "The Post" and returned the 5 most similar movies.
